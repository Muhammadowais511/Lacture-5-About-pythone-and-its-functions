# Python Functions Practice â€“ Lecture 5

This repository contains my work from Lecture 5, focusing on **Python functions**.  
The project was developed in **Google Colab** and includes:

- Understanding built-in and user-defined functions  
- Working with parameters and arguments  
- Returning values effectively  
- Exploring variable scope (local & global)  
- Hands-on exercises for practice  

### Features
- Clear examples of each concept  
- Easy-to-follow Python code  
- Exercises for self-practice  

### How to Use
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Read the explanations and run the code cells.  
3. Try the exercises and modify code to test your understanding.  

### Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- Google Colab (or Jupyter Notebook)
